# Auto-Layout-Practice

## Our Goal
Auto Layout and setting constraints in Xcode is both a complex topic and also involves very little Swift programming. That’s why we’ve left it out for all the apps we have made so far. But now that you’re on your way to becoming a serious app developer, we’re going to cover the key parts of Auto Layout and Constraints so your apps can look good on any device.

Constraints allow us to set rules as to how we want our views to be displayed. Because mobile screens have different resolutions and sizes, we need these rules to tell the iPhone/iPad how it should layout the display. These rules allow our UI elements to be resized and positioned so that no matter which screen they are displayed on, they always look as the designer intended.

## What You Will Create

Although Dicee is already pretty dicey, we get into problems when we try to rotate the screen to landscape or if we have a screen size that is not the same as the iPhone 6. We will fix this and make sure that the app looks perfect no matter what type of iPhone the user has both in landscape and portrait modes.

## What You Will Learn


* How to add constraints and understanding how auto layout works.
* How to Pin and Align UI elements.
* How to create containers to configure advanced layouts.
* How to debug auto layout errors.
* Understanding what Xcode needs in order to correctly layout a design.
